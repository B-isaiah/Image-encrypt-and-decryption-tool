### Did I Just Encrypt a Cat?

I know you're curious, so let me explain how I did it!

Using **Fernet**, a symmetric-key encryption method, I managed to encrypt an image of a cat. Fernet is part of the cryptography library in Python and is designed to be both easy to use and highly secure. Here are some of the advantages of using Fernet encryption:

- **Simplicity**: Fernet simplifies the encryption and decryption processes, making it accessible to developers with varying levels of expertise.
- **Security**: Fernet uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode and employs a Message Authentication Code (MAC) to ensure data integrity and authenticity.
- **Speed**: Fernet encryption and decryption are fast, which is crucial for real-time or near-real-time applications.

To get started with Fernet encryption in Python, you'll need to install the cryptography library. You can do this using pip, the Python package manager:

```bash
pip install cryptography
```


And that's how I encrypted a cat! üê±üîí‚ú®
